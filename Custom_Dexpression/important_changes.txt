Important things that changed in the branch "devel"

HISTORY
- previously commented out LRN_1 layer is added again
- test_recursive..V2 also generates subjectId's in seperatefile
- my_dexpression file seperates a train and validation and test set from the data with no overlapping subjects.

NOW
- added code to easily run on condor => needs to be UNCOMMENTED when tranfering becuase it doesn't work on jupyter
- algorithm now loads data and the division of subjects over datasets(train,val,test) and distributes the data using this division
- code to easily generate these division is to be added
